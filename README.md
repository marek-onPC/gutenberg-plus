# blocksplus

BlocksPlus is a WordPress extension plugin for Gutenberg editor.
It is my main project to have something fun to do with code when Iâ€™m getting bored.

### Why WordPress and Gutenberg?

**WordPress**, because with releasing a plugin to the wider audience, I can run a small scale project on my own, where the end-user experience plays the crucial role in development process.

**Gutenberg**, because this content editor is built with React.js, and its API is heavily based on this JS library. With this, I can work in an environment I like, yet it is not 100% React, and that forces me to look for new solutions and trying different things.

### Technologies

Project built with:
- JavaScript (with JSX syntax)
- PHP
- Gutenberg's Block API
- NMP
- Gulp

Maybe some of (beloved) TypeScript in future? Who knows...

### Development process

**1.** Checking which future could be created/fixed/adjusted (currently based mostly on my own experience with content management)
**2.** Looking for affordable way of implementing it, with keeping the backwards compatibility
**3.** Coding, coding, coding
**4.** Testing the feature on different WP instances
**5.** Release
